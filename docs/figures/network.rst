Association network
===================

Network visualisation of associations between protein domains and chemical classes extracted from 
CHAMOIS’s logistic regression model coefficients (Supplementary Table 2). 
Each class (circle) is linked to Pfam domains (square) with weights >=2.0. 
Classes are coloured according to their highest-level ancestor in the ChemOnt taxonomy. 
Pfam domains are coloured by their top-level EC number, obtained with the ECDomainMiner tool(:doi:`10.1186/s12859-017-1519-x` :pmid:` 28193156`).
