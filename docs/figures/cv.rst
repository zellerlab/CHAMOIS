Cross-validation
================

Evaluation of CHAMOIS against N=1,598 BGCs with known metabolites from MIBiG 3.1. 
Model performance on every predicted ChemOnt class (N=539) using stratified grouped 5-fold cross-validation. 
Classes are displayed as nodes within the ChemOnt hierarchy and coloured according to CHAMOIS’s performance 
for the respective class, as assessed by the area under the precision-recall curve 
(AUPRC, see colour key). Precision-recall curves for selected classes are shown as insets against the 
baseline obtained by random guessing (dashed horizontal lines corresponding to class proportions).
